MY LIFE AS AN EXTRA
Have you ..... spent the morning in a restaurant with a Hollywood film star? Well, I have - lots
of times! In fact, this morning, I've .... had a cup of coffee with Denzel Washington. He was
here only ten minutes ..... ! And ..... Thursday, I sat in a caf√© with Reece Witherspoon.
But it's not what you think. I'm not their best friend or anything. I'm a Hollywood extra. Extras, or
supporting artists, are the people you see in the background in films. I've worked as an extra .....
2010, and I've ..... appeared in over thirty films. I hope to be in a lot more. In all that
time, I've ...... spoken a single word, or been in a scene ..... more than thirty seconds!
That's the thing about being an extra. We walk up and down silently, or pretend to read newspapers,
or look in shop windows. Oh, and we don't get paid much!
